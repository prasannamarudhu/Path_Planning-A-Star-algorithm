# Path_Planning-A-Star-algorithm
Autonomous Path Planning of a Robot from source to destination using the A* Algorithm


Steps to Run the program

Python Modules:

The following modules are used in the program
1)numpy
2)math
3)operator
4)matplotlib
5)queue

Install all the above mentioned modules in the python3 version for running the
program.

Run Steps:
If you are running in the Ubuntu version 16.04:
➢ Install python-3
➢ Install all the above mentioned modules in the python3 version for running
the program.
➢ Run the ‘.py’ python files (A-Star_Point, A-Star_Rigid) one after the other.

➢ Then feed the inputs in the console as per requested. 


If you are running the code in pycharm IDE:

➢ Run this python program through python 3.7 version with numpy and other
requested modules being installed in it.

➢ Run the ‘.py’ python files (A-Star_Point, A-Star_Rigid) one after the other.

➢ Then feed the inputs in the console as per requested. 

➢ Then press ‘Enter’.

➢ The program will run and shows the simulation video of the algorithm.
(Please be patient until the program runs to obtain the goal path, sometime
it takes more time, but not more than 15 minutes)

➢ The Matplotlib module in python is used to visualize the simulation
movement in GUI.
